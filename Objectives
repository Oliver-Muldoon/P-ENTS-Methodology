Objectives of the P=ENTS Methodology

Building Thriving Communities Worldwide

"Therefore everyone who hears these words and puts them into practice is like a wise man who built his house on the rock. The rain came down, the streams rose and the winds blew and beat against that house; yet it did not fall, because it had its foundation on the rock. But everyone who hears these words of mine and does not put them into practice is like a foolish man who built his house on sand. The rain came down, the streams rose and the winds blew and beat against that house, and it fell with a great crash."

The objective of the P=ENTS methodology is to establish a comprehensive and open-source framework that empowers individuals and groups to create and sustain thriving communities founded on the transcendental values of truth, goodness and beauty. 

By providing a practical and adaptable approach with a strong foundation, this methodology aims to transcend cultural, linguistic and societal boundaries, fostering harmonious and purposeful relationships among people in truthful, beautiful and good communities worldwide.

Empowering Communities
The P=ENTS methodology strives to equip communities of all sizes and types with the tools and knowledge to sustain healthy, well-functioning communities and build wisely from that foundation. Through decentralisation and self-replication, it aims to empower individuals to take an active role in shaping their communities, promoting social impact and a sense of ownership, personal responsibility and collective well-being.

Open-Source Collaboration
By choosing to embrace an open-source approach, the P=ENTS methodology encourages worldwide participation, collaboration and contributions. It seeks to eliminate any and all barriers to entry and foster a collective effort towards refining and enhancing the methodology based on diverse perspectives, experiences and cultural insights. This ensures evolution and adaptability to various contexts, where required, but without losing sight of its core values.

Spreading the Methodology
A key objective of the P=ENTS methodology is to disseminate its principles and practices far and wide. By promoting free accessibility and ease of use, it aims to enable individuals and communities globally to adopt this framework for creating and sustaining truth, beauty and goodness. The goal is to create a ripple effect, inspiring a sense of the sacred and influencing various domains, including, but certainly not limited to, open source development projects, sports clubs, online gaming communities, multi-generational neighbourhoods, co-working spaces, schools, universities, companies, organisations, national electorates - and even astronauts living in the International Space Station. The opportunities are limitless.

Providing Meaning and Purpose
Recognising the importance of finding meaning and purpose in life, the P=ENTS methodology seeks to address this fundamental human need. It aims to provide people with a framework that guides them towards a deeper understanding of their personal values, aspirations and responsibilities within the context of community. By aligning actions with P=ENTS core values, pillars, principles and tenets, individuals can experience a sense of fulfilment, purpose and contribution to the greater good.

Counteracting Negative Influences
Lastly, the P=ENTS methodology aspires to be a force against the detrimental effects of evil and negativity in the world. By promoting the values of truth, goodness and beauty, it seeks to counteract corrupting forces, offering a positive alternative that promotes respect for tradition, gradual evolution and preservation of the three transcendental values. The methodology encourages individuals and communities to uphold these values as guiding principles in their interactions, decision-making processes and overall conduct.
