# P-ENTS - Open-Source Community Building Methodology

Welcome to my personal GitHub profile! My name is Oliver Muldoon, and I'm the creator and primary contributor to the P=ENTS Methodology. I'm passionate about community building and believe in the power of collaborative efforts to create thriving and impactful communities.

## Project Description
The P=ENTS methodology is an open-source approach to community building that aims to empower individuals and communities of all sizes and types. It provides a strong framework to guide community builders through the challenges and opportunities they face, while promoting truth, beauty and goodness as the foundational values of community development.

## Vision and Objectives
The vision of the P=ENTS methodology is to equip communities with the tools and knowledge to sustain healthy, well-functioning environments that promote social impact, ownership and collective well-being. By emphasising the 4 pillars of education, narrative, transparency and structure, we strive to foster truthful, beautiful and good relationships within communities.

## Getting Involved
I welcome contributions from individuals passionate about community building and those who want to improve and expand upon the P=ENTS methodology. If you have suggestions, improvements or additions, please submit them through pull requests. Let's collaborate and create a positive impact together!
